📘 Design & Implementation of a Multi-Campus University Network Infrastructure
📌 Overview

This repository contains my semester project for the Computer Networks (BSCS-5) course. The goal was to design and simulate a complete enterprise-level network infrastructure for a university with six distributed campuses, using Cisco Packet Tracer.

🌍 Project Scenario

Each campus includes Admin, Faculty, Students, Server Rooms, and Wi-Fi Zones. The network is designed with VLANs, VLSM subnetting, WAN links, routing protocols, and security layers — giving a realistic model of a multi-site university network.

🔧 Key Features

VLSM IP Addressing and structured subnetting

VLAN Segmentation for Admin, Faculty, Students & Servers

Inter-Campus WAN Connectivity (MPLS/VPN/Serial + Backup Links)

Routing Protocols: OSPF, EIGRP, RIP & Static

Network Services: DHCP, DNS, Web Server, NAT, ACLs

Security & Redundancy: STP/RSTP, Port Security, HSRP/VRRP
